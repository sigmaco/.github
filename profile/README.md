**SIGMA FEDERATION** is the federal management administration for **SIGMA** (*Special Interest Group Management Administration*), which is a Latin technopolitical collective established in 2011 by enthusiasts on cybernetics, security and state intelligence from Leste and Guanabara to foster pragmatic development, as well as supersede and obsolete the institutional, economic, and epistemological structures that have historically failed its claimed purpose. it has since expanded into a post-institutional federation; reorganizing diverse operational sectors into a cybernetically coordinated, transdisciplinary organism.

Leveraging systems science, cybernetics, and strategic design, **SIGMA** confronts colonial residues, bureaucratic stagnation, and technological dependency by creating adaptive, intelligent, autonomous systems. It seeks not reform, but replacement; reprogramming the future through design, narrative, and federalism.

This channel is coordinated by the **SIGMA Technology Group**, in association with the **Archivo Federal**, the **Bibliotheca Federal** and **Scitech** enterprise.
The main works are sensitive and thus are restrict (and not public) for strategic reasons. Other works were and/or are actually led by **SIGMA Technology Group** and **Engitech** enterprise.
In last years, this channel is being used to respond to requests by modding communities, software archaeologists, and retrocomputing activists for lost, abandoned or retired softwares important to these communities to fix old products and keep them working. Such requests are eventually responded as it does not collide with commercial interests held by copyright holders partnered with the **SIGMA**. Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.
You can also contribute or address to any doubt or difficult although any of the SIGMA FEDERATION's entry points.
