**SIGMA FEDERATION** is the federal management administration of the special interest groups on cyber science, technology and engineering, cybercultism and technocracy from Latin America, as well as their resources, assets and rights, under the common authority and singular titularity of the **SIGMA**.

**SIGMA** is a Latin American technopolitical collective established in 2011 by enthusiasts on state intelligence, public security and cybernetics from [Espírito Santo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esp%C3%ADrito_Santo) and [Guanabara (Rio De Janeiro)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro_(state)) to foster pragmatic development, as well as supersede and obsolete the institutional, economic, and epistemological structures that have historically failed its claimed purposes. The collective HQ had been originated as **SIGMA Co.** (**Special Interest Group Management Administration**), it has since expanded into a post-institutional federation — reorganizing diverse operational sectors into a cybernetically coordinated, transdisciplinary organism.

Leveraging systems science, cybernetics, and strategic design, SIGMA confronts colonial residues, bureaucratic stagnation, and technological dependency by creating adaptive, intelligent, resilient, autonomous systems and initiatives as well as fostering continuous integration and participation. It seeks not reform, but replacement — reprogramming the future through design, narrative, and federation.

The main works are sensitive and thus are restrict and not public for strategic reasons. Other works were and/or are actually led by SIGMA Technology Group.
Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.
You can also contribute or address to any doubt or difficult although any of the SIGMA FEDERATION's entry points.
